A simple Java implementation of BloomFilter. 


* User can initialize a BloomFilter with bucket size and number of hash functions as arguments.
* For hash functions, murmur hash implementation of Google Guava library is used. 
* To create multiple hash values, initially 2 hash values are calculated using murmur hash, and then their linear combination is used to calculate the indices in the bucket.
